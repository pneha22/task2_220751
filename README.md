Layers of the OSI Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to describe the communication functions of a telecommunication or computer system. It is divided into seven layers, each of which corresponds to a specific function that network systems must perform. These layers are:

Physical Layer
Data Link Layer
Network Layer
Transport Layer
Session Layer
Presentation Layer
Application Layer

7)
Physical Layer
The Physical Layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device and a physical transmission medium. This layer deals with the electrical and mechanical specifications of the physical interface and the transmission medium, including connectors, pins, use of pins, electrical signaling, and transmission medium.

Protocols and services associated with this layer include:

RS-232
Ethernet
USB
Bluetooth
ZigBee
HDMI
6)
Data Link Layer
The Data Link Layer is responsible for the reliable transfer of data between adjacent network nodes and includes the necessary functions to support error-free transmission of data frames over the physical layer. This layer deals with issues such as framing, flow control, error control, access control, and addressing.

Protocols and services associated with this layer include:

Ethernet
Wi-Fi
Token Ring
Frame Relay
HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control)
PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)
5)
Network Layer
The Network Layer provides routing and addressing services to move packets across multiple networks, and includes the necessary functions to support internetworking. This layer deals with issues such as routing, congestion control, and addressing.

Protocols and services associated with this layer include:

IP (Internet Protocol)
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
4)
Transport Layer
The Transport Layer is responsible for providing reliable end-to-end communication between devices on a network, and includes the necessary functions to support process-to-process communication. This layer deals with issues such as segmentation, reassembly, flow control, and error control.

Protocols and services associated with this layer include:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
SPX (Sequenced Packet Exchange)
DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol)
RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol)
3)
Session Layer
The Session Layer provides the mechanism for opening, closing, and managing a session between end-user application processes, including the synchronization of their data exchange. This layer deals with issues such as session establishment, data exchange, and session termination.

Protocols and services associated with this layer include:

NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)
NFS (Network File System)
PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)
RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol)
SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
2)
Presentation Layer
The Presentation Layer is responsible for data translation and code formatting services, ensuring that information sent from one system will be readable by the recipient system. This layer deals with issues such as data representation, encryption, and compression.

Protocols and services associated with this layer include:

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code)
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group)
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
1)
Application Layer

Protocols:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Telnet (Telecommunications Network)
SSH (Secure Shell)
DNS (Domain Name System)
Services: Provides access to network resources and enables user applications to transfer data over the network. Includes services such as web browsing (HTTP), email exchange (SMTP, POP3, IMAP), file transfer (FTP), remote system management (Telnet, SSH), and domain name resolution (DNS).
